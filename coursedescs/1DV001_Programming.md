# 1DV001 - Programming (7.5 hec)

## Prerequisites

None.

## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

- Explain basic programming language constructs, such as variables, iteration, and functions.
- Explain basic algorithms and data structures, and show how use them.

*2.	Skills and abilities*

- Given a problem, design and implement a solution in a programming language.
- Formulate and implement algorithms to solve elementary programming problems, such as sorting and searching.
- Test and debug simple programs

*3.	Judgement and approach*

- Reason about how well structured and understandable a program is.
- Pick and motivate what data structures and algorithms to use in different scenarios.
