# [%PrelCode] - [%Name] ([%HEC] hec)

## Prerequisites

1MA003, 1FY002.

## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

- Describe the design methods pole­placement, lead­lag compensation, feed­forward
and cascade compensation.
- Understand the function of simple controllers (PID controllers, lead-lag filters, state feedback) and controller structures (feedforward and cascade control)

*2.	Skills and abilities*

- Make a mathematical model for a simple dynamical system.
- Make a stability analysis for an open system and for a closed control
system.
- make reasonable estimates of a transient response and the steady­state
response based on the pole­placement of the closed system or on the Bode
diagram for the open system. 
- Based on a block diagram simulate the behavior of the system in the time domain.

*3.	Judgement and approach*

- Understand relationships and limitations when simplified models are used to describe complex dynamical systems

## Course contents

- Automatic control: history, examples of control system and basic concepts of automatic control.
- Modeling of dynamical system using time invariant ordinary differential equations.
- Linearization, state­space model, weighting function, Laplace transform, transfer function, Nyquist­ and Bode diagram.
- Analysis of dynamic system. Concepts of stability. Analysis of stability using Root locus, Routh­Hurwitz criterion,the principle of the argument and the Nyquist criterion. Gain margin and phase margin.
- Synthesis of control systems. Specifications, pole­placement, lead­lag compensation, PID­controller, feed forward, cascade compensation, robustness, sensitivity for disturbances and changes in parameters.

## Examination

Written exam and practical assignments.
