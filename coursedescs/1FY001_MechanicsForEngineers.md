## Prerequisites

1MA001, 1MA002, 1MA003.

## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

- Have a basic knowledge of statics and dynamics in classical mechanics including the mathematical formalism.
- Have a basic understanding of the scientific method including the importance of experiments, theory and their relationship.

*2.	Skills and abilities*

- Have the ability to formulate and solve problems relating to static and dynamic mechanical systems.
- Have the skill to use conservation laws to simplify the solution of problems.
- Have the ability to plan and execute experiments including estimation of uncertainties.

*3.	Judgement and approach*

- Assessment of measurement errors and uncertainties

## Course contents
