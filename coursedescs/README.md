# Course descriptions

Format course descriptions according to the `TEMPLATE.md` file. Make sure that `STATUS.md` is updated. All files are in [(Github flavored) Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## Headings

Use the fake course codes or a fixed number of credits to specify prerequisites. 

Provide a brief description of the purpose of the course under *Aim* and use *Course content* to describe what the course will cover. Provide a few outcomes in each category under *Learning outcomes* (not more than 10).

If the course already exists, add the current course and a brief description of any changes under *Overlap*

## Name and codes

Feel free to improve the course names and codes. The first digit should represent the level: 1 = G1F, 2 = G2F/E, 4 = AIN, 5 = A1F/A2E.
