# 1DV011 - Embedded systems

## Prerequisites

1DV004, 1DV008, 1FY001, 1FY002.

## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

- Analyze the schedulability of a periodic task set
- Display knowledge of and be able to explain how operating systems structured and works, especially when it comes to interrupts, processes, threads, and scheduling
- Explain scheduling anomalies, their causes, and how to avoid/mitigate them.

*2.	Skills and abilities*

- Analyze the schedulability of a periodic task set
- Implement programs that can control hardware devices using I/O, for example a serial bus.
- Implement interrupt routines.

*3.	Judgement and approach*

- Use different methods to determine if scheduling is possible.
- Understand the interface between hardware and software, and know limitations and risks.
